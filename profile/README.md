# OSS Compass Community

Welcome to the OSS Compass Community! 

We provide a public SaaS platform [OSS Compass](https://compass.gitee.com/) for open source community health analytics, that is open for all the projects hosted on Github, Gitee, etc.

# Our Vision

* Through [OSS Compass](https://compass.gitee.com/), we help people who need community data analysis, including but not limited to OSPOs, community managers, academic researchers, project owners, maintainers, developers, etc.
* By analyzing real data from a large number of open source projects, and referring to research results from industry best practices and academics, we create an open source community [Ecosystem Evaluation System](https://github.com/oss-compass/docs/tree/main/metrics-models) that can be continuously improved and evolved, and give back to the general open source communities by means of [OSS Compass](https://compass.gitee.com/).
